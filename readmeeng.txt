A small extra. info on my games.

In Tilt'em All, the control is done by moving the cursor or finger across the screen, which tilts the level itself. The goal of the level is to move the object(s) to the goal (s).
This game has two modes: maze and funnel. In the first one, you need to tilt the maze to get the ball to the end of the level (marked green), in the second one-throw all the balls into the funnels.
There is also a store and save progress.

In Farmer's Delight, the main goal is to survive the maximum number of rounds while defending your home. There are four types of enemies: normal zombie, small zombie, big zombie and
mini-boss. Each of them has its own differences. Zombies(mini-boss is not included in their number) have their own logic for switching between the player and the house. They also have a search engine
paths to the object. Take a close look at the main menu, because there you can see the entire map, including the location of weapons and perks to buy. The player can carry up to 2 guns, and at
the beginning of the game has only one gun. Perks are only available for purchase between rounds.
